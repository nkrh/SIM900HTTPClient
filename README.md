# SIM900HTTPClient
A simple HTTP client library for Arduino with SIM900 GSM module. Current version is unstable and has been tested on Arduino UNO R3 (yet).

Before using this library make sure you have configured the RX & TX pin at SIM900HTTPClient.h, and the APN stuff at SIM900HTTPClient.cpp method connect().
